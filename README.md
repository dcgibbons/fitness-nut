# Fitness Nut

Fitness Nut is an fitness and nutrition calculator built for the iOS platform.
This project was both my original learning experience for iOS development,
as well as building a tool for some common fitness and nutrition questions
I had when trying to optimize my own body composition during training.

Fitness Nut was a commerical iOS application for several years, but I 
removed it from the AppStore in 2016 as I was no longer maintaining it.

As of April 1st, 2018 (no April Fool's), I am releasing Fitness Nut as an
open-source application as reference material. This software is released
under the MIT open-source license - see [LICENSE](LICENSE)
